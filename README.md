# kaggle_Rossmann
This is my first Kaggle competition project. In this project, using the historical sale data from different Rossmann stores, we will try to predict the futher sales.  
  
[explore.ipynb](explore.ipynb) contains statistics and explorationary analysis on the data.  
  
In [xgb.py](xgb.py), I tried the usage of xgboost with some feature engineering.  
  
In [groupxg.py](groupxg.py), I built a xgboost model for each store and achieved better prediction.
